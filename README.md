# ReliveSpritePacker
Tool to convert rendered sprites from Blender into spritesheets compatible with RELIVE

## How to use (may change in the future)
1. Open the Asset Tool and let it extract all of the sprites into "hd/sprites"
2. Override the extracted sprites with batch rendered sprites from Blender
3. Run RELIVE to let it extract content as well
4. Put the ReliveSpritePacker folder inside "relive_data/ae/animations"
5. Drag all of the folders from "hd/sprites" onto the ReliveSpritePacker.exe
6. The sprite packer will then convert the sprites and update the associated json files
