1. Open the Asset Tool and let it extract all of the sprites into "hd/sprites"
2. Override the extracted sprites with batch rendered sprites from Blender
3. Run RELIVE to let it extract content as well
4. Put the ReliveSpritePacker folder inside "relive_data/ae/animations"
5. Drag all of the folders from "hd/sprites" onto the ReliveSpritePacker.exe (you can also drag their parent folder instead, if there are too many)
6. The sprite packer will then convert the sprites and update the associated json files
